          I am a frontend-focused web developer. I love building web applications that
          solve real world problems and making those applications accessible to everyone.
          I am looking to pivot my career to the web development domain and continue
          honing my web development skills.

          I currently work as a systems engineer at Northrop Grumman. I write software in
          a language similar to C# or Java to create physics-based models of aircraft
          interactions. I'm responsible for adding new features to the models, conducting
          code reviews, and briefing analysis packages to stakeholders.

          I graduated summa cum laude from San Diego State University with a bachelor's
          degree in mechanical engineering.
