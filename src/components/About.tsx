          This is a longer description about me. It'll talk about how I have been working
          as a systems engineer for the past ~2 years and how that work relates to web
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll also talk about how I have an engineering degree and how it helps me: think
          critically using first principles, technical learning, technical communication
